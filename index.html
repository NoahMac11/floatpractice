                <p>The Tibetan mastiff is a large Tibetan dog breed belonging to the mastiff family. Its double coat 
                    is long, subject to climate, and found in a wide variety of colors, including solid black, 
                    black and tan, various shades of red (from pale gold to deep red) and bluish-gray (dilute black), 
                    often with white and blue markings.</p>

                <p>These strong willed dogs are self-reliant and they take control of every critical situation. Tibetan 
                    mastiffs are quite calm and quiet unless someone is willing to provoke. This animal can set a good 
                    example of patience. The quality of being patient with its own children and family pets is appreciable.</p>

                    take down a lion.</p>

                <p>Tibetan mastiffs love their family most however they hardly expose it but they love 
                    spending time with them and protect them. One can blindly trust over that because they 
                    have been guarding people and property for more than 2000 years.</P>

                <p>The Tibetan Mastiff is an ancient breed that has lived and worked in Tibet for thousands of years. 
                    We might never know their exact history or how they came to be. Still, it is believed that the 
                    Tibetan Mastiff is the ancestor of many modern-day Mastiff-type dogs.</P>
